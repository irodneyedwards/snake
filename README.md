### Project Challenge

For your final project you will create a game inspired by the 80’s arcade. You’ll put together all the programming 
techniques we’ve learned: branching, looping, data structures and functions along with a couple of new concepts: 
events and graphics. This project will extend the simulation concept from the midterm to include real-time interaction 
with a user and an ending condition based on user input.

<!-- ### Final Thoughts

For best experience, run in another console or IDE, that is not PyCharm.
PyCharm has a bug on text-rendering which prints the formatting of my game_board incorrectly.
